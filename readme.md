# Overview

This is a personal iOS application project using Github's public APIs. The architecture used for this project is TCA. On app launch, you will be presented with a list of Github usernames with their public avatar. Tapping on one of the users will open the user detail screen modally, with a list of unforked repositories from that corresponding user. Tapping on each repository will open the URL towards the homepage of the repository.

# How to use

Before you can start using this project, please replace "Github Personal Token" completion placeholder inside `Core/GithubClient.swift` file, with your own personal token generated by Github. That's all!

# Improvement points

- Replace personal token with login mechanism instead

- Search function for the user's list

- Shimmering loading UI
